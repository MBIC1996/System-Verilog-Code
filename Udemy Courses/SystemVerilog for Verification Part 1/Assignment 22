//Create two tasks each capable of sending a message to Console at a fixed interval. Assume Task1 sends the message "Task 1 Trigger" at an interval of 20 ns while Task2 sends the message "Task 2 Trigger" at an interval of 40 ns. Keep the count of the number of times Task 1 and Task 2 trigger by adding a variable for keeping the track of task execution and incrementing with each trigger. Execute both tasks in parallel till 200 nsec. Display the number of times Task 1 and Task 2 executed after 200 ns before calling $finish for stopping the simulation.
